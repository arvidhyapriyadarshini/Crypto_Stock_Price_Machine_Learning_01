#  Cryptocurrency Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project
Data Science Projects/ Machine Learning
Cryptocurrency price prediction has become a popular area of interest for investors, traders, and researchers. By utilizing Python, we can leverage powerful libraries and tools to develop models that forecast cryptocurrency prices. In this project, the cryptocurrency price prediction model uses Python and AutoTS Machine learning algorithms to predict the values of Bitcoin for the next 10 days.

# Fetching and Analyzing Bitcoin Price Data
Python pandas and yfinance libraries are used to download Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance. This historical data is used for further analysis. 

# Predicting Stock price for the next 10 days

I have utilized the AutoTS library for automated time series forecasting. The AutoTS model is created with specific parameters: a forecast length of 10 time periods, an inferred frequency, and a simple ensemble approach. The model learns patterns and relationships within the data to make accurate predictions.

# Results
The model has predicted the Stock price of BitCoin for the next 10 days to be:
